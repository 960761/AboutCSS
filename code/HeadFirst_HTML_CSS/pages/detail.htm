            <h2><a id="C1-2">Chapter1-2 basic structure of Html</a></h2>

            <p>
                    The basic structure of Html is Head and body, of cource do not forget Html<br>
                     <em>a</em> element can be used to add a link to another web page.
                      There are some important attributes of &lt; a &gt; element, such as: <br><em>title</em> attribute , it can give a tip note about the link page, <br>
                     <em>id</em> attribute,it can define an anchor,so that you can redirect to the specific location of a web page by adding #id to the <em>href</em> attribute.<br>
                     if you put <em>img</em> as the content of <em>a</em> element, then the img will also be clickable and will be a link to somethings else.<br>
                     <em>target</em> attribute, it can make the link page open in a new window, you can name it _blank, or a specific name.
            </p>

                    You can find the <a href="#C1img">key points of Chapter1</a>  from the following  screenshot of "HeadFirst Html with CSS".<br>
                    You can find the <a href="#C2img">key points of Chapter2</a>  from the following  screenshot of "HeadFirst Html with CSS".

             <h2><a id="C3">Chapter3 from stretch to webpage</a></h2>

             <p>
                     The first thing of a web page is a sketch, just write in picture, 
                     <br> Then from sketch to a  outline with basic Html element,
                     <br>Last, translate from outline to a web page with Html elements.
              </p>

              <p>
                    You can use <em>q</em> element to add a quota, which is text with special style , for example: <q>this is my quote</q> and <q>here is double quote</q>
              </p>

              <p>
                    <em> q </em> element only used for short quote, and  shown inside a paragraph, if you want to have a long quote and want to be shown seperately, then you can use
                    <em> blockquote</em> element, for example: 
              </p>
              <blockquote> hello, my dear, you know that wherever you want to to ,then you will to.</blockquote>
              <p>
                    In fact,they are two different kinds of elements: block element and inline element.
                    <br><em> br </em> element can help you to begin a new line without using paragraph element.
               </p>

               <p>You can alse use Html to present a list, there are two steps ,as follow:</p>
               <ul>
                     <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put each list item in an <em>li</em> element;</li>
                     <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enclose your list items with either the &lt; ol &gt;  stands for ordered list, or <em>ul</em> stands for unordered list</li>
               </ul>
