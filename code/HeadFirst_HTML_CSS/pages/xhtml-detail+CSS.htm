                     <em>id</em> attribute,it can define an anchor,so that you can redirect to the specific location of a web page by adding #id to the <em>href</em> attribute.<br />
                     if you put <em>img</em> as the content of <em>a</em> element, then the img will also be clickable and will be a link to somethings else.<br />
                     <em>target</em> attribute, it can make the link page open in a new window, you can name it _blank, or a specific name.

                    You can find the <a href="#C1img">key points of Chapter1</a>  from the following  screenshot of "HeadFirst Html with CSS".<br />
                    You can find the <a href="#C2img">key points of Chapter2</a>  from the following  screenshot of "HeadFirst Html with CSS".

             <h2><a id="C3">Chapter3 from stretch to webpage</a></h2>

             <p>
                     The first thing of a web page is a sketch, just write in picture, 
                     <br /> Then from sketch to a  outline with basic Html element,
                     <br />Last, translate from outline to a web page with Html elements.
              </p>

              <p>
                    You can use <em>q</em> element to add a quota, which is text with special style , for example: <q>this is my quote</q> and <q>here is double quote</q>
              </p>

              <p>
                    <em> q </em> element only used for short quote, and  shown inside a paragraph, if you want to have a long quote and want to be shown seperately, then you can use
                    <em> blockquote</em> element, for example: 
              </p>
              <blockquote> <p>hello, my dear, you know that wherever you want to to ,then you will to.</p></blockquote>
              <p>
                    In fact,they are two different kinds of elements: block element and inline element.
                    <br /><em> br </em> element can help you to begin a new line without using paragraph element.
               </p>

               <p>You can alse use Html to present a list, there are two steps ,as follow:</p>
               <ul>
                     <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put each list item in an <em>li</em> element;</li>
                     <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enclose your list items with either the &lt; ol &gt;  stands for ordered list, or <em>ul</em> stands for unordered list</li>
               </ul>

             <p>The first thing to do will  be to add some basic indicators, for example:<br />
                   The first line ahead of &lt;html&gt; element would be:<br />
                   <img src="../imgs/html-head.gif" alt="html DOCTYPE tag"/><br /><br />
                   The first line of &lt;head&gt; part would be:<br />

            <h2><a id="C11">chapter 11: Advanced CSS: div and span </a></h2>
              <p><em>div</em> is used to divid logical section of <em>block element</em>, which are logically related. It is pure structure,it does not have any look or default style.</p>
              <p><em>span</em>is used to divid logical section of <em>inline elements</em>logically related,it is also a prur structure, have no default style. </p>
              <p><em>a</em> is a special element, the style changes depending on its state,including visited, unvisited, hover etc.</p>
            
            <h2><a id="C12">chapter 12: Advanced CSS: position and layout </a></h2>
              <p><strong>float</strong>If you want the page to be seperated into 2 columns, you can use this property. You can do in the following steps:<br />
                 1.Seperate the content into two divs,2. set the width and float attributes of the part you want to float.<br />
                 when you set a div to float, it will be romoved from the flow, and other elements will respect the boundary of the float div.<br />
                  Remeber, you should put the content that you want to float right under the head part. And the width of the fload part does not change.<br />
                  You can alse set the <em>margin</em> attribute to keep<br /> the two columns distinct.You can use<em>clear</em> property to fix the overlap problem of floating and un-floating part.</p>
                 <p>liquid & frozen layout:</p>
                 <p>absolute positioning: when set to absolute position,like float, the part is removed from the flow ,but unlike the float ,the other elements<br />
                 will not respect the bountry of the absolute div , instead, the other elements ignore it totally.</p>
                 <p><em>z-index</em>prperty: decide who will be on the top</p>
                 <p>4 position property:<br />
                 <em>static:</em><br />
                 <em>absolute:</em><br />
                 <em>fixed:</em><br />

                <em>tr:</em>table row<br />
                <em>td:</em>table data<br />
                for cell, there is <em>cell-spacing</em> instead of <em>margin</em>,you can use <em>border-collapse</em> to combine the cell space of two cells.
